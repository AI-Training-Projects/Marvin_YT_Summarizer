## Summary

The video discusses building AI agents using a simple library. AI agents are intelligent programs designed to automate tasks and enhance user experiences. Key components include a model, memory, external database, and access to tools. The video introduces a library called "fi data" for building AI agents efficiently with tools. The presenter demonstrates creating a simple UI using an AI app builder called "data button," sharing the app-building process with fast API routers and integrating the YouTube agent API for summarizing videos. The focus is on utilizing "fi data" for AI agent construction and showcases a practical example of building an agent to summarize YouTube videos and integrate with front-end UI using data button's capabilities.

## Full Transcript

I think this is the simplest library to build AI agents so what are AI agents AI agents are intelligent programs that can achieve complex task by taking actions we use them to automate repeatable workflows and build or rather enhance new user experiences the key components of an agent is that it must have a Model A large language model that can be from goare or from open AI or from anthropic it is also desirable for an agent to have a memory a persistent memory where the interaction between an LM and a human is remembered or it is stored in an agent is also recommended to have an external database it can be the vector index database or it can be your PDF file or CSV or a txt file and another key part which makes agent very powerful is its accessibility to different tools tools tools are nothing but a function which a particular agent can perform according to particular queries from the user this particular Library which is called as fi data which was trending just couple of weeks back over GitHub is really powerful yet very simple to build AI agents especially when we integrate that with tools so in this particular video we'll look how we can build an agent with just few lines of python code and not only that that on top of it we will build a very simple UI using an AI app builder called as data button he guys welcome back and if you're new here I am overo I love building apps with the latest AI Stacks from the large language model to the newest cool orchestration Frameworks which allow us to build powerful AI agents or AI apps after finishing my PhD I was so much into this that I left Academia and joined an AI startup where we are creating an AI app builder which allows everyone to build fullstack apps in natural language as I work I'm always trying out the latest AI tools and if I find something very interesting I love to document them and share with you all so in today's video I'll be sharing one of these tools which I've been using for the last couple of days and I feel that you guys will really enjoy using this tool and build something cool with it so let me show this app which I built with five data agent with very simple use of a back end we can build this kind of agent so I'll quickly go to the very last video which is about swarm uh group of Agents working together secretly so what I would do is I will just copy this YouTube url come to our app and I will paste this here hit the load video button next part would be to summarize it for me and here where it calls the YouTube agent which I've already built which we would discuss in this video and this API call would allow us to summarize the entire video with just few lines as you can see it says at this video titled how to build multi-agent systems uh the presenter demonstrates the multiagent chatboard focusing on Healthcare scenarios it was a real uh demo use case please check out this video I'll leave somewhere the link and the video elaborates implementation process using swamp package this newly swarm open a package which came out it Additionally the tut integrates swarm with data button this app is buil in data button which is an AI app builder to build your fullstack app powerful react front end which you can build and also a fast aay router we will build in this tutorial so we will start building our YouTube agent UI with few outline of our app the peit for our app is an AI agent that answers about any YouTube videos it should have a placeholder for YouTube URL and it would also have a chat query box and a response box for the agent and then its targeted audience are the content creators also the design rule is very simple it's minimal and I will hit generate starting point and data button will create the very first UI for us so now as you see data button initialized the app extracted the design guidelines which we gave it and it's also writing the code for us and you will see in no time it comes with the very first UI for our app and here we go it is loading the very first homepage for our app it's almost 120 lines of code and here you go all you to do is now pass any YouTube video here and you can see it so the first thing I would do is I just copy this link from here and go to the data button app and paste it here and here goes the video which is embeded here we can display it and watch it ourself but no that's not what we want to do here the next part we should be able to build the agent so for that we we do a very simple hack what you do is just go and C Cy this URL link come to data button and say button that could you please build back and call YouTube agent research this URL which you just copyed from the dos and come up with a plan for us and I hit the enter button this particular prompt would make data button to research review the findings and come up with a proper plan which you can execute to build a back end here note here data button builds python back in here and this entire code is written in react and shartan libraries and now as you can see it's has already started to install the packages based on the context which it could research from the URL by the way it has already start to generate the YouTube agent created a particular router for us which is nothing but a fast API router in data button we create fast API router which gets connected to the front end created this agent two routers one to process the URL and the next one is to ask question using this particular URL which it takes in I hope this would work and datab button is already in a mission to install the packages for us if you want to see where these packages are getting installed we can just come to this config page and here where all the packages are getting store for example the open a package which is pre-installed and this is a five data package and the P tube and the YouTube transcript API which is also getting installed right now so once we finish this we would love to test this back end I'm pretty sure there are few nitty-gritty which we need to fix for example how to use the open AI because as I mentioned before we need a large language model to work with AI agents uh there are two main end points it's not summarizing one is the process URL it takes a YouTube URL and returns there another Endo called as the ask question which takes a video IDE and question returns AI generated answer about the video if we can integrate this to the front end it ask me would you like to update the front end to integrate this endpoint we can t the function with a real YouTube video I think integrate the API calls I think we should go for it I chose one of the smart prompt suggestion what did you do now is it would integrate this to the homepage that is the react code which is written here and in data button if you want to integrate this python or the fast AP router to your front end there is an internal module called as brain this brain is the internal module which this agent knows very well to handle and it starts to integrate to the front end and as you can see it's it failed once it says fail to update the code and then it's reading the code at the homepage and now it's writing code for us it's now a updating as you can see in real time it imported the brain module the internal module how which it handles uh the fast API router integration to the front end and now it says it has finished integrating it so it's time to see what it has already built I'm pretty sure it has build this back end for the load video now it has ritten few of the parts so I'll just add this URL here hit the load button and it shows that it processed the video and it dumped it here that's pretty cool all I would do is uh hey and I pass this there's a question which is already sent the API call but still I see an error and this is a very validator it says that the open API key is not set in the environment variable we need to add the open API key and I would do that now so I sent a prom that we want to uh add the open API key and we will store in data buttons secret uh secret environment so here I pass the open API key and I hit the send button if you not see here out here the config page again and here where we added the secret key and it's added by data button I just passed that placeholder and it stored it back to data button's secret management section and now it will update this YouTube agent use datab button's own internal python library to do that using DB db. secrets to use the open API key and I just ask again hey and I hit the enter it's now asking the question to this router it's using that AP router called the asked question and in no time came up with a very proper response which we see here just not dumping the result back to the chat and this is my first prompt which I'm saying that it has the result which we see in the console log but it's not showing in the UI that's a sad part we need to fix that small thing and let's see if we can fix that right away out here it has already updated our endpoint and says that it has successfully also it has test at the end point it says it's seems like it's working so is still updating that and it said I have fixed the issue by updating the ask question end point to use agent. run instead of agent. print response the response should now be properly return to the front end and display in the chat instead of agent. print response which we had before we use aent do run and that's what h helps to dumb the response back to the UI I think this can be better understood when we just copy a URL of a video this was my last video where I explained in details and showed the entire building process where building an app are teams of agent working together I think you should watch the videos I'll leave the link somewhere here watch the video and you will see how easily the entire thing was built within data button test it with that particular link live video we will summarize this video can you please summarize this video for me and I hit the enter button it will make a call to our backend which is a YouTube agent which is using fi data and I hope in no time you will see the response out here and here you go the video title which is clickable as well it's dumping in markdown if you look at the code carefully it's using react markdown here and all the response are getting formatted in mark down and that's why we see this very nicely formatted one I'll will also come to the five data part where it's using the markdown format but let's see the summary in summary in this video The Creator goes live for the first time to Showcase building a multi- agent AI app using five data I would say not F data a library for building intelligent agent systems which we spoke in the very beginning of this video we discuss further few of the key points which we discuss in this entire app it's pretty amazing that we can build this simple UI in no time just via prompting with this powerful back end and this front end has react shoten and it also has python back end and we can deploy now just hit this deploy button and in no time data button would take care of the deployment and it will be available for everyone with a particular URL link let's look at this back and very carefully especially the agent part if you see the agent is using this particular method called called as agent it is using the tools the YouTube tools which we imported using this fi data module f. tools. YouTube tools and it is using couple of arguments for example the short tool calls what does that do if you have remember the print which came there there were debugging tools which it also come up with we can make this false or true when you are building in your Dev version you can just always make it true to see what is getting passed on if you want to add a extra description you can use this description there are lot of other arguments which you can pass as well entire how this API works you will see all this all these parameters and these agent parameters can be passed can pass what an user ID should be you can pass user data you can pass the session ID things which also comes very important context to it you can also add an instruction how it would be passed and the other part the output for format expected output the guidelines the instructions even the limit tool access you can play with if it should use the YouTube tools or not those are also possible using this arguments I would definitely ask you guys to go through this it is super powerful and it's always the simplest yet powerful way of building agents that what F allows at using fire data for the purpose of building AI agents simply and and I Showcase in this use case of tool using this YouTube Tool we can build powerful agents with it and that's why I would say if you guys you really want to build fer is a great choice for that
